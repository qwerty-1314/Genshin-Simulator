# Artifact Simulator
Ever wanted to know how long it takes to get a 50CV artifact? \
Run `simulator.py` to start rolling artifacts. \
The program will tell you how long it took to get your desired Crit Value on average. It uses 1 fragile resin per week, assumes unlimited fodder and throws all artifacts in the strongbox.
